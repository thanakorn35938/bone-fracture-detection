# Bone Fracture Detection System
This project is use for my personal science project of 2023. This project will use Tensorflow and YOLOv7 with ArsNet5 to maximize eeficency and accuracy in tection system. For years, Human have been reading x-ray film. With increasing work hours of doctor and nurse, Misdiagnose might occur. This program Will help them to diagnose patient under their supervision.

## How to run this system ?
### 1. Install required dependencies
For this project you will need
 - Python => 3.11
 - Tensorflow
 - Anaconda
 - Visual Studio Code
### 2. Start setting up your system.
#### Cloning this repository
```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/thanakorn35938/bone-fracture-detection.git
```
After that please follow instruction on your screen.

##### Thank you, Goodluck,
